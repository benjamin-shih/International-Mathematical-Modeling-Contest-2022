# International-Mathematical-Modeling-Contest-2022
Our submission and relevant files for the 2022 International Mathematical Contest for Modeling. Our team consisted of [Roy Kim](https://github.com/immikyor), [Alexander Zheng](https://github.com/pebblepebpeb), and me, and we responded to ICM Problem E regarding carbon sequestration and forest harvesting. The solution we came up with involved a discretized, stochastic model for tree growth in the context of various types of forests. Using this model, we analyzed the total carbon sequestration over time by altering parameters such as harvest frequency, thresholds for harvesting, and tree composition to determine the forest management strategy that will maximize carbon sequestration.

Please consult our paper and relevant notebook/images for more information on models and techniques used as well as simulation strategy and results. Our paper was awarded Honorable Mention (top 22%) out of over 12,000 submssions.
